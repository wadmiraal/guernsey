# Guernsey
An experimental module, to see how well we can apply TDD principles in Drupal 8.

This module will define all functionalities to power a small book club. The name's in honor of the great book, [The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guernsey_Literary_and_Potato_Peel_Pie_Society).
